# Avocado Prices Prediction Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis of avocado prices, focusing on predictive modeling using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand the factors influencing avocado prices and predict future trends, aiding decision-making in the agricultural and retail sectors.

## Project Overview
- **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: The initial phase involves data extraction from a large dataset, followed by data cleaning to ensure accuracy for analysis.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Analysis of seasonal patterns in avocado prices, using time series forecasting to study patterns in both conventional and organic avocado types.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  1. **Linear Regression**: Employed to establish a relationship between avocado prices and volumes.
  2. **Decision Tree Regressor**: Used for classification and prediction of avocado prices, with evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MSE, and MAE.

## Results and Discussion
The analysis confirms that avocado prices decrease as volume increases, with this trend observed in both conventional and organic types. The Decision Tree Regressor model demonstrated high accuracy, as indicated by low MSE values, proving its effectiveness in predicting avocado prices.

## Technologies Used
- R Programming
- Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, DataExplorer

## Conclusion
This project highlights the utility of R in handling and analyzing large datasets for predictive modeling. It demonstrates the capabilities of Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor in providing valuable insights for the avocado supply chain.
