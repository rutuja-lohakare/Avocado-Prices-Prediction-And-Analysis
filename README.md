## Data Analysis using R

This repository contains 
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis to predict the average price of Avocados
  2. Application of Data Mining and Business Intelligence / Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression) to study the pattern of Avocado prices
I have also performed data visualization using R. To see the plots/detailed steps, please refer the document.

## Problem Statement
Avocado has become one of the world's trendiest foods. As the poster child of millennial healthy eating, this superfood is now a mainstay for foodies everywhere. Avocado prices have rocketed in recent years by up to 129%, with the average national price of a single Hass avocado reaching $2.10 in 2019, almost doubling in just one year. The main objectives of this study were to predict avocado prices using the data gathered by Hass Avocado Board (HAB) - a trade organization that provides industry professionals with research and data on avocado prices around the world. Next is to find out pattern in attributes that affect the prices of avocados. 

## Data Description
The data represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (ex: greenskins) are not included in this table.
